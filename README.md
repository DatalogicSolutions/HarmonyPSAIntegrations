# HarmonyPSAIntegrations

A place to create and share integration tools and implementations for the HarmonyPSA business management system.

This repository holds code samples for querying data out of Harmony and posting updates to Harmony.
The samples are currently only in C# and include a utility class for building query requests to Harmony.

If you port this or any other samples to any other languages, or add new samples in, we are welcoming pull requests.

Kind Regards

The Harmony Team
